            A page fault is an exception raised by the memory when a process accesses a memory page without the necessary preparations,

            The page contents may also need to be loaded from a backing store such as a disk.
            While the MMU detects the page fault, the operating system's kernel handles the exception by either making the required page accessible in physical memory or denying an illegal memory access.
            Valid page faults are common and necessary to increase memory availability in any operating system that uses virtual memory, including Windows, macOS, and the Linux kernel.

            Memory bounce is a technique used in the Linux kernel to handle situations where direct memory access (DMA) is required but the physical memory being accessed is not contiguous. This can happen when a device, such as a network interface card or a disk controller, requires access to a large amount of memory that is not available as a single contiguous block.

            To handle this situation, the kernel uses a technique called memory bouncing. In memory bouncing, the kernel sets up a temporary buffer in physical memory that is large enough to hold the entire data block being transferred by the device. The data is then copied from the non-contiguous source memory to the temporary buffer, which is physically contiguous.
